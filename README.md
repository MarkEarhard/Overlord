This is a Django app that I am working on that uses the EVE Online ESI API interface.

My intent is to use this to manage my SP farm.

Please note-  Alliance Auth, which this is not based on in any way, is a much better application
and if you can use AA you probably should.  This is an example app for those that want to roll their
own.
